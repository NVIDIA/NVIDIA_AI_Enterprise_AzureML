## Adding Data Assets to the Registry

The steps in this README needs to be done only once when you are registering your Data Assets on AzureML for the first time. Later you can just use these registered Data assets in your pipeline

```
$ cd nvaie/src/dataassets/RAPIDS
$ bash register_dataassets.sh
```
